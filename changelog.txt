    - isteamutils.h
    - isteamvideo.h
    - steamhttpenums.h
    - steamtypes.h

* use Unicode when sanitizing settings, mainly for local_save.txt config file
  + new dir "utfcpp": containg all the source/include files of this library: https://github.com/nemtrif/utfcpp
  + common_includes.h: include the new library "utfcpp"
  + settings.cpp: in Settings::sanitize(): convert to utf-32 first, do the sanitization, then convert back to std::string and return the result

* avoid locking the global mutex every time when getting the global steamclient instance
  + dll.cpp: in get_steam_client(): only lock when the instance is null and double check for null, should speed up things a little bit
* in different places, avoid locking gloal mutex if the relevant functionality was disabled
  + example in steam_user_stats.h: SetAchievement()
  + example in steam_overlay.cpp:
    > Steam_Overlay::AddMessageNotification()
    > Steam_Overlay::AddInviteNotification()

* explicitly use the ASCII version of Windows APIs to avoid conflict when building with define symbols UNICODE + _UNICODE
  - base.cpp: GetModuleHandleA()
  - steam_overlay.cpp: PlaySoundA()

* fix the implementation of RtlGenRandom stub:
  + return a number
  + use extern "C" if building in C++ mode

* add new build scripts for both Windows and Linux for a much easier dev/build experience,
  both Windows and Linux scripts will run parallel build jobs for a much faster build times,
  by default, the scripts will use 70% of the max available threads, but if the auto detection didn't work,
  you can pass for example -j 10 to the scripts to use 10 parallel jobs
  
  on Linux, archives (.a files) of third party libraries are bundled wholly, and built statically via:
  -Wl,--whole-archive -Wl,-Bstatic -lssq -lcurl ... -Wl,-Bdynamic -Wl,--no-whole-archive
  this ensures that the final output binary (for example: libsteam.so) won't require these libraries at runtime

  + to build on Linux (I'm using latest Ubuntu on WSL)
    - run as sudo ./build_linux_deps.sh, this will do the following:
      > download and install the required build tools via apt-install
      > unpack the third party libraries (protobuf, zlib, etc...) from the folder third-party to build-linux-deps
      > build the unpacked libraries from build-linux-deps
      
      you only need this step once, additionally you can pass these arguments to the script:
      -verbose: force cmake to display extra info
      -j <n>: force cmake to use <n> parallel build jobs
      
    - without sudo, run ./build_linux.sh and pass the argument "release" or "debug" to build the emu in the corresponding mode,
      this will build the emu inside the folder build-linux
      some additional arguments you can pass to the script:
        -lib-32: prevent building 32-bit libsteam_api.so
        -lib-64: prevent building 64-bit libsteam_api.so
        
        -client-32: prevent building 32-bit steamclient.so
        -client-64: prevent building 64-bit steamclient.so
        
        -tool-clientldr: prevent copying the script steamclient_loader.sh
        -tool-itf: prevent copying the script find_interfaces.sh
        -tool-lobby-32: prevent building executable lobby_connect_x32
        -tool-lobby-64: prevent building executable lobby_connect_x64
        
        +lowperf: (UNTESTED) pass some arguments to the compiler to prevent emmiting instructions for: SSE4, popcnt, AVX
        
        -j <n>: force build operations to use <n> parallel jobs
    
  + to build on Windows (just install Visual Studio 2019/2022)
    - without admin, run build_win_deps.bat, this will do the following:
      > unpack the third party libraries (protobuf, zlib, etc...) from the folder third-party to build-win-deps
      > build the unpacked libraries from build-win-deps
      
      you only need this step once, additionally you can pass these arguments to the script:
      -verbose: force cmake to display extra info
      -j <n>: force cmake to use <n> parallel build jobs
      
    - without admin, run build_win.bat and pass the argument "release" or "debug" to build the emu in the corresponding mode,
      this will build the emu inside the folder build-win
      some additional arguments you can pass to the script:
        -lib-32: prevent building 32-bit steam_api.dll
        -lib-64: prevent building 64-bit steam_api64.dll
        
        -ex-lib-32: prevent building experimental steam_api.dll

        -tool-itf: prevent building executable find_interfaces.exe
        -tool-lobby: prevent building executable lobby_connect.exe
        
        +lowperf: (UNTESTED) for 32-bit build only, pass the argument /arch:IA32 to the compiler
        
        -j <n>: force build operations to use <n> parallel jobs

* added all required third-party libraries inside the folder "third-party"

* greatly enhanced the functionality of the generate_emu_config script + add a build script
  + run recreate_venv.bat to
    > create a python virtual environemnt
    > install all required packages inside this env
  + run rebuild.bat to produce a bootstrapped .exe built using pyinstaller
  + inside the folder of the built executable
    > create a file called my_login.txt, then add your username in the first line, and your password in the second line
    > run the .exe file without any args to display all available options
    

* revert the changes to SetProduct() and SetGameDescription()

* in steam_overlay.cpp: AddAchievementNotification(): prefer original paths of achievements icons first, then fallback to "achievement_images/"

////////// older changes
* add missing implementation of (de)sanitize_string when NO_DISK_WRITE is defined which fixes compilation of lobby_connect

* check for empty string in (de)sanitize_file_name() before accessing its items

* implement new API: GetAuthTicketForWebApi()
  + base.h: declare the new API: getWebApiTicket()
  + base.cpp: implement the new API: Auth_Ticket_Manager::getWebApiTicket()
  + steam_user.h: call the new API inside GetAuthTicketForWebApi()

* add missing note in ReadMe about libssq

* add new release 4 by ce20fdf2 from viewtopic.php?p=2933673#p2933673
